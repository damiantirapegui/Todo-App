## Tools Used

  - **Serverless Framework**
  - **IAM user**
  - **APIGateway**

- **Visual Studio Code** as the code editor

## Testing and Access

The application is hosted on an S3 bucket. If you wish to test it, please email me directly to request access. The URL link is currently deactivated but can be enabled upon request.
